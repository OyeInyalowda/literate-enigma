<h2>Greetings! :)</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to my 'projects' page. This page was created as a means to display both personal and college related 
	programming projects. Please excuse the sad state of the page itself, I don't really know much about HTML 
	or CSS (yet). 
</p>

<h2>Programming Projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href='racquetball.html'> Racquetball v2</a> | Language: Javascript</li>
	<li><a href='racquetball-v3.html'> Racquetball v3</a> | Language: Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Racquetball version 2 is a small game made for a software engineering assignment. Its functionality is the same as 
	version 1 (not present) but re-written with a more object-oriented approach.
</p>
<p>
	Version 3 expands upon the original with some features that were beyond the scope of the original specifications. It
	has been good practice for learning more about Javascript.
